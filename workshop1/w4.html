    <h1>IS <a href = "view-source:http://bardcollege.github.io/workshop1/w4.html">CODE</a> <code>LANGUAGE</code>?</h1>

    <h3>Free-write on coding: <i>What happens when we swap languaging with coding; and language with code?
    How would the meaning of this statement change? What would the word code come to mean?</i>
</h3>

      "It’s hard to answer that question when coding is considered a language in itself.
      It’s a language that is understood by humans and an inanimate object which is fascinating--we’ve never been able to communicated
      via a language as effectively with actual animate creatures. Yet, we can create pieces of technology that do incredible things
      using code. The meaning of the statement changes into one of becoming a mediator between all things, not just between peers.
      Suddenly we can command an object to do complex procedures through a language. Code would just become a different language name
      with many different dialects within it. Code can also be interpreted to be a set of rules, which is interesting because Wittgenstein
      discusses how demands are the more primitive form of language. The code language between humans and computers is of the most primitive
      form. When he describes Person A demanding a stone, and Person B can understand and comply--but without response--it becomes the most
      simple form of communication. In the same way, we simply order our computers to deliver and they do. So now that I think about it,
      the definition of “code” is effectively the same: it is a language that delivers a set of rules or demands.
      
      "The <a href = "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">Analytical
      Engine</a> has no pretensions whatever to <i>originate</i>
      anything. It can do whatever we <i>know how to order it</i> to
      perform. It can <i>follow</i> analysis; but it has no power of
      <i>anticipating</i> any analytical relations or truths. Its province is
      to assist us to making <i>available</i> what we are already acquainted
      with." &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>

      "Presumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his shady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present problems. He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he can find them again if they prove important."
